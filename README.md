Note: This website is hosted using Square Online, meaning the code is safely locked away. However, this repository is home to the redirect page that navigates the user to the Square Online store, as well as the custom CSS stylesheet used to 'pixelize' it.

This also means that there is currently no `dev` server (hence the lack of a `dev.yml`).

## Sitemap

- `index.html` : Redirects to the Square online store
- `/css` : Holds custom CSS used on the Square online store (restyling elements)
- `/plastic-free-july` : Redirects to the Plastic Free July goods on the Square online store
- Other subdirectories may be used to redirect to specific categories, products, etc.

## Icons

Custom icons that are used on the Square online store are pulled from the [Pixel Planet Today website](https://pixelplanettoday.com) (access [GitHub repo](https://github.com/terrabyte-tech/pixel-planet-today-website)).
