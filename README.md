# shop-pixel-planet-today-website

Codebase for the Pixel Planet Today webstore. This repo is incredibly lightweight due to the nature of most files existing on Square. The repo includes a redirect file to go to said Square site, as well as resource files to support site development.

**Note:** There is currently no `dev` server (hence the lack of a `dev.yml`), meaning changes committed to `main` will be seen (close to) instantly.

## Sitemap

- `index.html` : Redirects to the Square online store
- `/css` : Holds custom CSS used on the Square online store (restyling elements)
- `/plastic-free-july` : Redirects to the Plastic Free July goods on the Square online store
- Other subdirectories may be used to redirect to specific categories, products, etc.

## Icons

Custom icons that are used on the Square online store are pulled from the [Pixel Planet Today website](https://pixelplanettoday.com) (access [GitHub repo](https://github.com/terrabyte-tech/pixel-planet-today-website)).
